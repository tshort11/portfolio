      <div class="title"><h2>Curiosity to career: My coding journey</h2></div>
      <div class="text">My fascination with coding began in my teenage years, but the complexity of it always seemed daunting, leading me to shy away from considering it as a career path. While I often struggled to articulate my dream job, I was consistently drawn to roles involving coding or software, which intrigued me deeply.
        <br><br>
        Despite this, I initially pursued more conventional career options. I briefly studied nursing before shifting to finance, though neither field resonated with me. Realising that university wasn't the right fit, I transitioned into various roles, from retail to office work. Throughout this period, my curiosity about coding and software remained a constant.
        <br><br>
        After several years of exploring coding independently, I reached a turning point. Determined to overcome my apprehensions and forge a career in something I had always been passionate about, I made the decision to enroll in Coder Academy. This step marked a significant commitment to confronting my fears and charting my own path in the tech industry. By taking this leap, I am embracing the career I have long aspired to, without allowing intimidation to hold me back
