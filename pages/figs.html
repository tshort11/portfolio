One of nature's most intriguing deceptions is what I like to call the “fruit fallacy.” As someone deeply passionate about fruits and their aesthetics, I’ve often found myself let down by how their looks and names don’t always match up to their flavour.

I even tried figs again a year later, after consulting experts on what makes a “good” fig; not believing such a thing even exists. Unfortunately, the result was the same
